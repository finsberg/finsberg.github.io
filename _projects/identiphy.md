Recent advances in human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) research have led to the creation of "heart-on-chip" in vitro models, which are small pieces of lab-grown cardiac tissue. These models, with their ability to mimic human phenotypes, hold great potential in transforming the drug development process for pharmaceutical companies. However, there are still challenges in effectively integrating these systems into development pipelines. The objective of the IdentiPhy project is to develop and validate technology that enhances the prediction of compound safety risks using optical measurements from "heart-on-a-chip" microphysiological systems (MPS) and a computational framework based on a new mathematical approach. By combining stem cell tests with computational analysis, we aim to improve the efficiency of drug development pipelines, reducing costs and time required to bring safe drugs to the market.
