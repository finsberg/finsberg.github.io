Individually personalized computational models of heart mechanics can be used
to estimate important physiological and clinically‐relevant quantities that are
difficult, if not impossible, to directly measure in the beating heart. Here, we
present a novel and efficient framework for creating patient‐specific
biventricular models using a gradient‐based data assimilation method for evaluating regional myocardial contractility and estimating myofiber stress. These
simulations can be performed on a regular laptop in less than 2 h and produce
excellent fit between measured and simulated volume and strain data through
the entire cardiac cycle. By applying the framework using data obtained from 3
healthy human biventricles, we extracted clinically important quantities as well
as explored the role of fiber angles on heart function. Our results show that steep
fiber angles at the endocardium and epicardium are required to produce simulated motion compatible with measured strain and volume data. We also find
that the contraction and subsequent systolic stresses in the right ventricle are significantly lower than that in the left ventricle. Variability of the estimated quantities with respect to both patient data and modeling choices are also found to be
low. Because of its high efficiency, this framework may be applicable to modeling
of patient specific cardiac mechanics for diagnostic purposes.
