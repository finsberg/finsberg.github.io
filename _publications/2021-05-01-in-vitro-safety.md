title: "In vitro safety “clinical trial” of the cardiac liability of hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin as COVID19 polytherapy"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/in-vitro-safety
excerpt: 'This study presents a chronic preclinical drug screening platform, a cardiac microphysiological system, to assess the cardiotoxicity associated with repurposed hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) polytherapy in the context of a mock phase I safety clinical trial. The platform accurately predicted clinical outcomes and identified biomarkers for negative effects on tissue function, morphology, and antioxidant protection, providing valuable insights for clinicians in designing trials and accelerating access to safe COVID-19 therapeutics.'

Only a handful of US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Emergency Use
Authorizations exist for drug and biologic therapeutics that treat severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Potential therapeutics include
repurposed drugs, some with cardiac liabilities. We report on a chronic preclinical
drug screening platform, a cardiac microphysiological system (MPS), to assess cardiotoxicity associated with repurposed hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and azithromycin (AZM) polytherapy in a mock phase I safety clinical trial. The MPS contained
human heart muscle derived from induced pluripotent stem cells. The effect of drug
response was measured using outputs that correlate with clinical measurements, such
as QT interval (action potential duration) and drug-biomarker pairing. Chronic exposure (10 days) of heart muscle to HCQ alone elicited early afterdepolarizations and
increased QT interval past 5 days. AZM alone elicited an increase in QT interval from
day 7 onward, and arrhythmias were observed at days 8 and 10. Monotherapy results
mimicked clinical trial outcomes. Upon chronic exposure to HCQ and AZM polytherapy, we observed an increase in QT interval on days 4–8. Interestingly, a decrease
in arrhythmias and instabilities was observed in polytherapy relative to monotherapy,
in concordance with published clinical trials. Biomarkers, most of them measurable
in patients’ serum, were identified for negative effects of monotherapy or polytherapy
on tissue contractile function, morphology, and antioxidant protection. The cardiac
MPS correctly predicted clinical arrhythmias associated with QT prolongation and
rhythm instabilities. This high content system can help clinicians design their trials,
rapidly project cardiac outcomes, and define new monitoring biomarkers to accelerate
access of patients to safe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) therapeutics.
