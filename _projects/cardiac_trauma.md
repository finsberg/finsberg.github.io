title: "Advanced in silico cardiovascular modeling in hemorrhagic shock"
excerpt: "This project aims to simulate heart activity and heart tissue behavior during severe hemorrhagic shock, with an emphasis on speedy testing. We'll be using entirely computer-based models for this. The initial outcomes of this project will be two linked models running on a supercomputer: one model will represent the overall heart and blood vessel changes during hemorrhagic shock, and the other will represent heart tissue, for example, a group of cell models in tissue reacting to the body-wide stress caused by these conditions"

This project is coordinated by Dr. John Green at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and is a collaboration between him, Alan Garfinkle, Jakub Tomek, Simula and the SciML team led by Dr. Christopher Rackauckas Julia Hub.
