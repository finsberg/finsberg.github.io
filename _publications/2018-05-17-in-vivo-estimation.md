excerpt: 'This study introduces a data assimilation technique to estimate personalized models of cardiac mechanics with heterogeneous elastic material properties, specifically in the context of myocardial infarction. The method is tested using clinical data, demonstrating good matches to regional strains and providing insights into stress-strain relationships. This is the first application of adjoint-based data assimilation to estimate cardiac elastic heterogeneities in 3D from medical images.'

In myocardial infarction, muscle tissue of the heart is damaged as a result of ceased or severely impaired blood flow. Survivors have an increased risk of further complications, possibly leading to heart failure. Material properties play an important role in determining post-infarction outcome. Due to spatial variation in scarring, material properties can be expected to vary throughout the tissue of a heart after an infarction. In this study we propose a data assimilation technique that can efficiently estimate heterogeneous elastic material properties in a personalized model of cardiac mechanics. The proposed data assimilation is tested on a clinical dataset consisting of regional left ventricular strains and in vivo pressures during atrial systole from a human with a myocardial infarction. Good matches to regional strains are obtained, and simulated equi-biaxial tests are carried out to demonstrate regional heterogeneities in stress–strain relationships. A synthetic data test shows a good match of estimated versus ground truth material parameter fields in the presence of no to low levels of noise. This study is the first to apply adjoint-based data assimilation to the important problem of estimating cardiac elastic heterogeneities in 3-D from medical images.
