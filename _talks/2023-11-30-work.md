Several researchers here in Oslo are working on projects related to myocardial work who may have several common issues and topics to discuss. We therefore organize this regional work seminar so they can present their current projects and to stimulate networking.

In my presentation I present the differences with using more traditional ways of estimating stress among clinicians with finite element based approaches.
