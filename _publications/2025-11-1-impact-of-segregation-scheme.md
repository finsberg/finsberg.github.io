Fully coupled cardiac electromechanics simulations have in the last few years become feasible on a tissue and organ scale. However, free and open-source tools for running these simulations are still limited. Furthermore, due to the high computational expense of coupling electrophysiology (EP) and mechanics, investigations into choice of coupling scheme is warranted. In this study, we investigate the effect of the selected coupling scheme on accuracy and run time, implemented in a freely accessible, open-source software, Simcardems. We used the monodomain model and the ToR-ORd-dynCI model to describe EP on a tissue and cellular scale, respectively. Mechanics was modeled using an active stress approach. To represent passive tissue we used a Holzapfel-Ogden model of a transversely isotropic material, whereas the Land model was used to represent active contraction. The EP and mechanics …
