### Personal summary

In October 2017 I started as a Research Engineer at Simula Research
Laboratory in the department for Scientific Computing, and will work
with development of computational modeling tools primarily with application
in electrophysiology and mechanics.

Before I started as a Research Engineer I was a PhD student in the Cardiac
Modelling group in the department for Scientific Computing, also at Simula
Research Laboratory. In my PhD I worked with patient specific models of
the cardiac mechanics, and defended it at January 17th 2018.

I graduated in 2014 after finishing a joint master degree in Applied and
Engineering Mathematics at NTNU in Trondheim and DTU in Copenhagen. 

My fields of interests are mathematical modelling, scientific computing and 
high performance compting.
