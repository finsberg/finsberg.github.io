Background and ObjectiveCardiac drug safety assessment is essential to detect molecules with potential adverse effects, particularly those increasing the risk of arrhythmias such as Torsade de Pointes (TdP). The challenge lies in achieving early predictions with minimal experimental studies while maintaining high sensitivity and specificity. Traditional approaches rely primarily on electrophysiological (EP) biomarkers; however, mechanical effects of drugs on cardiac contractility remain underexplored. This study aims to integrate electrophysiological and mechanical biomarkers to improve cardiac risk assessment models.MethodsThe present study investigated the integration of electrophysiological and mechanical biomarkers using a cellular and three-dimensional in silico population approach. We evaluated the effects on different EP and mechanical relevant biomarkers to assess both, the proarrhythmic and …
