excerpt: 'In cardiovascular mechanics, achieving consensus in simulation results is crucial for reproducibility, and to address gaps in existing benchmarks, we propose new cardiac benchmark problems and solutions that include assessments of passive and active material behavior, viscous effects, and pericardial boundary conditions, with simplified analytical fiber definitions and active stress models for monoventricular and biventricular domains.'

In cardiovascular mechanics, reaching consensus in simulation results within a physiologically relevant range of parameters is essential for reproducibility purposes. Although currently available benchmarks contain some of the features that cardiac mechanics models typically include, some important modeling aspects are missing. Therefore, we propose a new set of cardiac benchmark problems and solutions for assessing passive and active material behavior, viscous effects, and pericardial boundary condition. The problems proposed include simplified analytical fiber definitions and active stress models on a monoventricular and biventricular domains, allowing straightforward testing and validation with already developed solvers.
