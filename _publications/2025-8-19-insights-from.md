 Abstract Heart failure is a cardiac pathology characterized by causing myocardial dysfunction. The need to improve current pharmacotherapy for patients with heart failure has encouraged the development of more promising compounds. Currently, the amount of experimentation required during the early phases of drug development to assess safety and efficacy is costly, but computer simulations can help accelerate the process. In the present study, we performed computer simulations to investigate the electromechanical effects of the sarcomeric drug omecamtiv mecarbil on cardiac tissue. We used a cellular human electromechanical model to develop a concentration‐dependent numerical model for the pharmacological compound based on previous experimental evidence. It was then implemented on a ventricular slab to extrapolate cellular activity to myocardial tissue scale, and heart failure with reduced ejection …
