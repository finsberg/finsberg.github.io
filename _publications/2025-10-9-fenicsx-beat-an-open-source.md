Summary fenicsx-beat is an open-source Python software package for simulating cardiac electrophysiology, built upon the FEniCSx finite element framework (Baratta et al., 2023). It provides tools to solve the Monodomain model, a widely used model for electrical signal propagation in cardiac tissue, coupled with systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) that represent complex ionic models governing cell membrane dynamics. Designed for researchers in computational cardiology, fenicsx-beat leverages the high-performance capabilities of FEniCSx to enable efficient and scalable simulations of cardiac electrical activity on various computational platforms.
