Computational models of cardiac mechanics, personalized to a patient, offer access
to mechanical information above and beyond direct medical imaging. Additionally, such models can be used to optimize and plan therapies in-silico, thereby
reducing risks and improving patient outcome. Model personalization has traditionally been achieved by data assimilation, which is the tuning or optimization
of model parameters to match patient observations. Current data assimilation procedures for cardiac mechanics are limited in their ability to efficiently handle
high-dimensional parameters. This restricts parameter spatial resolution, and thereby
the ability of a personalized model to account for heterogeneities that are often
present in a diseased or injured heart. In this paper, we address this limitation
by proposing an adjoint gradient–based data assimilation method that can efficiently handle high-dimensional parameters. We test this procedure on a synthetic
data set and provide a clinical example with a dyssynchronous left ventricle with
highly irregular motion. Our results show that the method efficiently handles a
high-dimensional optimization parameter and produces an excellent agreement for
personalized models to both synthetic and clinical data.
