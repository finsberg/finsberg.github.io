Cardiomyocytes are the functional building blocks of the heart—yet most models developed to simulate cardiac mechanics do not represent the individual cells and their surrounding matrix. Instead, they work on a homogenized tissue level, assuming that cellular and subcellular structures and processes scale uniformly. Here we present a mathematical and numerical framework for exploring tissue-level cardiac mechanics on a microscale given an explicit three-dimensional geometrical representation of cells embedded in a matrix. We defined a mathematical model over such a geometry and parametrized our model using publicly available data from tissue stretching and shearing experiments. We then used the model to explore mechanical differences between the extracellular and the intracellular space. Through sensitivity analysis, we found the stiffness in the extracellular matrix to be most important for the intracellular stress values under contraction. Strain and stress values were observed to follow a normal-tangential pattern concentrated along the membrane, with substantial spatial variations both under contraction and stretching. We also examined how it scales to larger size simulations, considering multicellular domains. Our work extends existing continuum models, providing a new geometrical-based framework for exploring complex cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions.
