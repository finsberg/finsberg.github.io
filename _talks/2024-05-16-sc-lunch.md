A beginner's guide to cardiac modeling: In this talk I will present different ways
we usually model the heart with the focus on developing new drugs. One
example is by looking at how to model a single cell, and how a single cell is
affected by a drug. Then I will try to show how this can be translated to the
whole organ an see how such models can be used to study safety and efficacy
of drugs at the level of the individual.
