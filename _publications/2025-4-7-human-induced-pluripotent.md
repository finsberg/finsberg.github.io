Cardiac organs-on-a-chip (OoCs) or microphysiological systems have the potential to predict cardiac effects of new drug candidates, including unanticipated cardiac outcomes, which are among the main causes for drug attrition. This protocol describes how to prepare and use a cardiac OoC containing cardiomyocytes differentiated from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPS cells). The use of cells derived from hiPS cells as reliable sources of human cells from diverse genetic backgrounds also holds great potential, especially when cultured in OoCs that are physiologically relevant culture platforms. To promote the broad adoption of hiPS cell-derived cardiac OoCs in the drug development field, there is a need to first ensure reproducibility in their preparation and use. This protocol aims to provide key information on how to reduce sources of variability during hiPS cell maintenance, differentiation, loading and …
