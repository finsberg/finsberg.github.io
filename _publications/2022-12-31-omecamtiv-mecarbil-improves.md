excerpt: 'This study presents a novel 3D electromechanical (EM) model to simulate the effects of inotropic drugs, specifically Omecamtiv Mecarbil (OM), on human cardiac tissue. The model successfully replicated concentration-dependent drug effects, such as increased active tension, but indicated the need for further development to capture the characteristic delay in time to peak contraction observed in experimental data.'

Inotropic drugs, such as Omecamtiv Mecarbil (OM),
are a promising treatment option for patients with heart
failure with reduced ejection fraction. However, there are
limited computational models available of fully coupled
electromechanics (EM) and OM. We present a 3D EM
model to simulate inotropic drug effects to assess
pharmacological mechanisms and effects on human
cardiac tissue. This fully coupled 3D EM open-source
solver (SimCardEMS) was used to simulate healthy and
failing tissue slabs. A model of OM behaviour was created
by using experimental data to parametrize the cell model
to replicate stabilisation of the pre-powerstroke state of
myosin.
The OM model replicates experimentally observed
concentration dependent drug effects such as increased
active tension with minimal effect on calcium transient.
Therapeutic concentration of OM (0.2 µM) increased
active tension by 33% in heart failure tissue. Total
displacement was reduced in heart failure, but was
partially recovered in the presence of 0.2 µM OM.
However, the characteristic delay in time to peak
contraction was not reflected in these results. These
simulations enable detailed assessment of drug
mechanisms and indicate that the model of OM in tissue
EM requires further development to better represent the
pharmacological effect.
