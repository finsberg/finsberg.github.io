This seminar aims to elevate the level of software development for scientific computing for PhDs, postdocs, and researchers. Participants will engage with expert-led sessions on best practices, covering topics such as code quality, reproducibility, scalability, and performance optimization. The session ends with an interactive workshop providing hands-on experience. By bridging the gap between scientific inquiry and software development, we aspire to enhance the robustness, efficiency, and accuracy of computational research.
